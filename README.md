## 🧠 Project Description

A mirror that detects your face and gives you completely unnecessary, backhanded, or utterly useless compliments — because you didn’t ask for it, and you probably don’t need it.

---

## 🕳️ The Problem (That Doesn’t Exist)

Sometimes, mirrors just reflect your face without *any* feedback. That’s boring. We’re solving the problem of emotionally passive mirrors in a world where everyone craves validation — even if it’s empty, confusing, or mildly insulting.

---

## 🧪 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

We added computer vision and a speaker to a mirror so it can:
- Detect your face in real time 👁️
- Play a random compliment (sweet, weird, or sarcastic) via text-to-speech 🎤
- Confuse you, boost your ego, or make you question everything 🤯
